# Foundations of Machine Learning Notes and Exercises

This repository contains personal notes and code exercises from the **Foundations of Machine Learning** course (A.Y. 2024/25), taught by **Prof. Tommaso Di Noia** as part of the **Master‚Äôs program in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** at **PoliBa ‚Äì Polytechnic University of Bari**.

## üöÄ Purpose of This Repository

This repository was created with the intention of helping future students gain a deeper understanding of Machine Learning. However, it is not limited to students alone‚Äîanyone interested in the subject can benefit from it!

### üìñ Contents of the Repository

- **ML Notes:** Notes of the course enriched with personal insights and reflections in form of a pdf file.  
- **Code Exercises:** Practical exercises implemented as Jupyter Notebooks (with scracth libraries implemented as Python scripts).  
- **Additional Resources:** Links to helpful external resources for further learning.


## üìù Learning Python, NumPy, and Pandas

For beginners learning **NumPy** and **Pandas**, the slides of `python_crash_course` released during the course should be sufficient. However, if you're interested in more detailed explanations and examples, consider exploring [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) by Jake VanderPlas. This repository contains the entire Python Data Science Handbook in the form of free Jupyter notebooks covering everything from NumPy and Pandas (Sections 2 and 3, respectively) to Matplotlib (Section 4) and beyond.

## üìÇ Code in This Repository
This repository primarily uses **Jupyter Notebooks** instead of Python scripts. 

A **Jupyter Notebook** is an interactive environment for writing code, running it, and displaying the output ‚Äî all in a single document. It‚Äôs especially useful for exploring data and creating visualizations while providing rich markdown for explanations.


### üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Repository

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your system.  

2. Inside VSCode, install the following extensions from the Extensions Marketplace:  
   - **Python**  
   - **Jupyter**

3.  Clone this repository (or download it as a zip): 
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Loux977/ML-Course.git
     ```

4. Move into the `code` directory and create a new virtual environment called `ml_venv`:
   ```bash
   cd code
   python -m venv ml_venv
   ```
    A virtual environment is a self-contained directory where Python projects can store dependencies. This keeps your project dependencies isolated from other projects.

5. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    Linux/macOS: source ml_venv/bin/activate
    Windows:     ml_venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   You‚Äôll know it's active when you see (ml_venv) at the start of the terminal prompt.

6. After activating the virtual environment, open the `00_intro.ipynb` notebook (`code` directory) in VSCode and follow the instructions inside. This notebook is specifically designed to help you set up and get familiar with working in Jupyter Notebooks. If you are already familiar with it you can skip it. 

Once you've completed the steps, you'll be all set to start exploring the other notebooks in this repository!
