    "#### Why Python?\n",
    "**Python** has become one of the most popular programming languages for scientific computing and data analysis, thanks to its simplicity, versatility, and robust ecosystem of third-party libraries. These libraries empower Python to handle complex data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks efficiently. Some key libraries we'll leverage include:\n",
    "- **NumPy**: For fast and efficient manipulation of array-based data.\n",
    "- **Pandas**: For working with heterogeneous and labeled data.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: For creating high-quality visualizations.\n",
    "- **IPython**: For interactive execution and code sharing.\n",
    "- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools (and many more) make Python a go-to language for modern data science, as you'll discover throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Jupyter?\n",
    "There are many ways to write and execute Python code. One way is by using Python scripts with a text editor (as done during the course), however I personally prefer working with **Jupyter Notebooks**. They provide an interactive environment where you can write, run, and immediately visualize code, all within a single document. Additionally, Jupyter supports Markdown, allowing you to combine rich text explanations alongside your code. This feature makes it ideal for exploring data, creating visualizations, and documenting insights in an organized and engaging way.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow this guideline, I suggest using **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** as the editor. If you haven’t already, you should install the `Python` and `Jupyter` extensions from the VSCode **Extensions** marketplace (found in the left sidebar of VSCode).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, for a better experience, I recommend opening the entire `ML-Course` directory via `File -> Open Folder` in VSCode. This will give you easy access to all files and help you navigate through the different sections smoothly.\n",

    "#### Working with Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "A **Jupyter Notebook** is organized into cells, which are blocks of content that can be executed or edited individually. There are two primary types of cells: **Markdown** cells, used for text explanations like this one, and **Code** cells, used for running Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add new cells to your notebook by using `+Code` or `+Markdown` buttons at the top of the interface. Cells can be deleted using the `bin` icon, or modified using the `edit` icon (both are visible on top-right part of the cell when you click on them). To execute a code cell, simply click the `play` button on its left side. Alternatively, you can run all cells in sequence using the `Run All` option at the top. The structure of the notebook makes it easy to experiment with code while keeping your work well-documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running any cell, you must select a **Kernel**. The kernel is the Python interpreter that will execute your code. In VSCode, click on `Select Kernel` at the top of the interface. Then, under `Python Environments` select the interpreter associated with the virtual environment you’ve created (e.g., `ml_venv`). If `ml_venv` is not listed, try restarting VSCode. If the issue persists, proceed as follows: open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS), search for `Python: Select Interpreter` and manually locate the path to your virtual environment’s Python executable:\n",
    "- Linux/macOS:  `/ml_venv/bin/python.exe`\n",
    "- Windows:  `\\ml_venv\\Scripts\\python.exe`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then check if `ml_venv` is listed, otherwise again close and re-open VSCode and this time it should detect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Required Libraries\n",
    "As first thing ensure that the `ipykernel` package is installed, as this is necessary for your Jupyter Notebook to connect to the kernel. You can install it by running:"
